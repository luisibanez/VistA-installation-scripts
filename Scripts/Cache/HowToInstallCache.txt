This directory contains instructions on how to setup Intersystems Cache in a
Linux machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL).

The overall process involves:

0) Create the cache user with the script

        ./createCacheUser.sh

1) Download from Intersystems the file

    cache-2008.2.5.951-lnxrh5x86_64.tar.gz

   put it in the ~/Downloads  directory.

2) Create a ~/tmp directory:    mkdir ~/tmp

3) Enter the ~/tmp directory:   cd    ~/tmp

4) Expand the cache  tar.gz file

    tar -xzf ~/Downloads/cache-2008.2.5.951-lnxrh5x86_64.tar.gz

5) Run the "cinstall" script with sudo:

             sudo ./cinstall

6) It will ask you

         1) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (x64)

         Enter the number for your system:

   Reply with "1" and ENTER


7) It will ask:

         Enter instance name <CACHE>:

   Reply with ENTER to accept the default


8) It will ask:

      Enter a destination directory for the new instance.
      Directory:

   Reply with

                  /opt/cachesys/


   it will answer that the directory does not exist,
   and

           Do you want to create it <Yes>?

   Hit ENTER to accept the default


9)  Then it will ask for the installation type

        Select installation type.
        1) Development - Install Cache server and all language bindings
        2) Server only - Install Cache server
        3) Custom - Choose components to install

    Select option 1 and hit ENTER


10) It will ask whether to install Unicode.

        Do you want to install Cache Unicode support <No>

    Accept the default "No" option and hit ENTER.


11) Then it asks about the security level

      How restrictive do you want the initial Security settings to be?
      "Minimal" is the least restrictive, "Locked Down" is the most secure.
          1) Minimal
          2) Normal
          3) Locked Down
      Initial Security settings <1>?

   Accept the default "1" option and hit ENTER.


12)  Specify the group that can start and stop the instance:

        What group should be allowed to start and stop
          this instance?

     Answer with

                    root

     and hit ENTER


13) The installer will ask about the license with:

        Cache did not detect a license key
        in directory /opt/cachesys/mgr.
        Do you want to enter a license key <No>?

    Reply with "No" at this point and hit ENTER.


14) The installer will present the summary
    of the options that you have selected and will ask
    for confirmation to proceed with the installation.


      Please review the installation options:
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Instance name: CACHE
      Destination directory: /opt/cachesys
      Cache version to install: 2008.2.5.951.0
      Installation type: Development
      Unicode support: N
      Initial Security settings: Minimal
      User who owns instance: root
      Group allowed to start and stop instance: root
      Effective group for Cache processes: cacheusr
      Effective user for Cache SuperServer: cacheusr
      SuperServer port: 1972
      WebServer port: 57772
      CSP Gateway: using built-in web server
      Client components: all
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

      Do you want to proceed with the installation <Yes>?


   Reply with "Yes" and hit ENTER


15)  At this point the installer will initiate the installation
     process.

     You will see the message:

                  Starting installation...

     followed by many other messages and finishing with:

               Setting to InterSystems defaults ... done.


                You can point your browser to http://localhost:57772/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp
                to access the system management portal.

                Installation completed successfully


15)  Fix a version issue with libexpat by creating a symbolic link

       ln  -s  /lib64/libexpat.so.1.5.2 /lib64/libexpat.so.0

     Once the link has been created, the files should look like:

                 cd /lib64
                 ll libexpat.so.*

       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root libexpat.so.0 -> libexpat.so.1.5.2
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root libexpat.so.1 -> libexpat.so.1.5.2


16)  This concludes the process for installing Cache.


17)  This additional step is not a recommended setting,
     and it is intended only as a convenience for settings
     of instances to be used for informal education and
     testing.

     By default, in order to stop and start the VistA
     instance, a user will have to use the following
     command with sudo:

                 sudo ccontrol start CACHE
                 sudo ccontrol stop  CACHE  quietly

     Since sometimes this is needed from testing scripts,
     it is convenient to avoid having to use sudo for this
     command. The following command give all users the
     permission to start and stop the database. Again, this
     is not a recommended setting at all for a production
     deployment.

            sudo chmod o+x /opt/cachesys/bin/cstart
            sudo chmod o+x /opt/cachesys/bin/cstop


18)  Install a service to stop / start cache when shutting down
     and rebooting the computere.

     Copy the "cache" file from this directory into

                  /etc/init.d/cache

     and ensure that the file has executable permissions, and
     ownership just as the other files in that directory.
